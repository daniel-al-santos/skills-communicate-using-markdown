## Adding an image through an URL
in this section they asked to put an image that contains a description for screen readers, benefit people with poor vision 
just for curiosity, the images that are indeed a png file worked as expected

syntax goes like :
#### ```![description](url)``` And the image will be displayed as the following: 

![github logo](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcShHxDqMF_tBdDItS9rMO_MaGPB3hpKFS5XfQ&s)

## Blocks of code

#### When we use blocks of code, we gonna need to specify the language before the closing quotes, lets put that way ``` <- Open/closing ones

```python

# tem o modulo flask e a classe


from flask import Flask
from flask import jsonify

#o app Ã© uma instancia da classe flask, onde passamos o nome do nosso app digamos assim
app = Flask(__name__)

# entender melhor como funciona a dinamica dos operadores @ na frente do objeto
@app('/rota',methods=['GET'])
def funcionalidade_da_rota():
  '''do some stuff'''
  return jsonify(value)

```
