# tem o modulo flask e a classe


from flask import Flask
from flask import jsonify

#o app Ã© uma instancia da classe flask, onde passamos o nome do nosso app digamos assim
app = Flask(__name__)

# entender melhor como funciona a dinamica dos operadores @ na frente do objeto
@app('/rota',methods=['GET'])
def funcionalidade_da_rota():
  '''do some stuff'''
  return jsonify(value)
```
